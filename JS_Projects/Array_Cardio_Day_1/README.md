# Array Workout Project

## Overview

This project is designed to provide hands-on practice with JavaScript array methods such as `filter()`, `map()`, `sort()`, and `reduce()`. It includes several exercises that demonstrate how these methods can be used to manipulate and process arrays.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled. No additional software is required.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Open the browser's JavaScript console to see the output of the exercises.

## Exercises

### 1. Filter the list of inventors for those who were born in the 1500's

Using the `filter()` method, this exercise filters out inventors born in the 1500s and logs the result in a table format.

### 2. Give us an array of the inventors' first and last names

Using the `map()` method, this exercise creates a new array containing the full names (first and last) of the inventors.

### 3. Sort the inventors by birthdate, oldest to youngest

Using the `sort()` method, this exercise sorts the inventors by their birth year from oldest to youngest and logs the sorted array in a table format.

### 4. Calculate the total number of years all the inventors lived

Using the `reduce()` method, this exercise calculates the total lifespan of all the inventors combined.

### 5. Sort the inventors by years lived

Using a combination of `map()` and `sort()`, this exercise calculates the age of each inventor at the time of their death and sorts them by age from oldest to youngest.

### 6. Create a list of Boulevards in Paris that contain 'de' anywhere in the name

This exercise is intended to be run in the console on the Wikipedia page for Boulevards in Paris. It demonstrates how to scrape data from a webpage using JavaScript.

### 7. Sort the people alphabetically by last name

Using the `sort()` method, this exercise sorts an array of people's names alphabetically by their last names.

### 8. Sum up the instances of each item in an array

Using the `reduce()` method, this exercise counts the number of times each item appears in the array and logs the result as an object.

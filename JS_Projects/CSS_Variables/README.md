## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to update CSS variables dynamically using JavaScript. It includes a simple HTML interface with controls to adjust spacing, blur, and theme color of an image.

## Features
- Dynamic update of CSS variables with JavaScript
- Range sliders for adjusting spacing and blur
- Color picker for changing theme color
- Responsive design

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory

## Usage
To run the project, simply open the `dubai_skyline.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Configuration
The project uses three CSS variables:
- `--spacing`: Controls the padding around the image.
- `--blur`: Controls the blur effect on the image.
- `--theme`: Controls the theme color applied to the text and image background.

These variables are updated dynamically based on user input from the range sliders and color picker.
